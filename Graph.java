// Graph.java
// ==========
// This is a framework for initializing a graph from an input file that contains
// an adjacency matrix. The first line of the input file indicates how many
// vertices are in the graph. The following n lines contain the adjacency matrix
// for the (zeros and ones). For example:
//
//    4
//    0 1 0 1
//    1 0 1 1
//    0 1 0 1
//    1 1 1 0
//
// ...which corresponds to the unweighted, undirected graph:
//
//    0---1
//     \ /|
//      X |
//     / \|
//    2---3
//
// These values are read into a boolean matrix, and we perform breadth-first and
// depth-first search traversals starting from an arbitrary vertex.
//
// The comments in this file are sparse in some places because I've already
// explained this code in class. In other places, the comments are unusually
// verbose because I want you to have a written copy of some of the comments I
// made about this code. In your programming assignments, please do not emulate
// the unbalanced commenting style I am employing here. :)
